The code of this repository is that of a 2.5D puzzle game called "GuideThisBuddy" (name is very likely to change).

Things done :
- Logic and functionning of the "MeshCurver" class, which deforms a mesh along a curve (in a fashion similar to that of Blender's curve modifier)
- "Bumper" plater
- "Cannon" plater (propulses a body over a long distance)
- "Sucker" plater 

Things I'm doing right now :
- Level system
- Fixing MeshCurver not remembering the meshes's shader and UV coordinates
- Not sleeping

Next on to-do list :
- "Lazer" plater 
- "Track" plater (a track continuously rotating in one direction)
- "Wheel" plater
- "Pusher" plater (pushes a body, whereas the bumper makes it, well, bump, so jump in the air)
- "Slicer" plater (slices a body in two)
- "Zapper" plater (teleports to another Zapper plater)
